🔒 Password Strength Checker Tool
A Python program that evaluates the strength of a password based on multiple criteria and provides helpful suggestions for improvement. This tool is a great way to understand password security principles and learn how to use regular expressions in Python.

🚀 Features
Strength Assessment: Classifies passwords as Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, or Very Strong.
Feedback and Suggestions: Offers specific tips to strengthen weak passwords.
Criteria Used:
Minimum length of 8 characters.
At least one uppercase letter.
At least one lowercase letter.
At least one number.
At least one special character (e.g., @$!%*?&).
User-Friendly: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
📋 How It Works
The program checks passwords against five key criteria and calculates the strength level based on the number of criteria met:

Very Weak (0-1 criteria met).
Weak (2 criteria).
Moderate (3 criteria).
Strong (4 criteria).
Very Strong (all 5 criteria).
For weaker passwords, the program provides actionable suggestions to meet the missing criteria.
